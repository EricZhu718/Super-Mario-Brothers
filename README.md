## Created the Mario Brothers game in which the character Mario runs and jumps around a 2D map in order to get to the flagpole. The game had gravity and could detect whenever Mario collided with a block. It also had mushrooms that Mario could eat to grow into adult Mario. There were mystery blocks in which Mario could open by hitting the bottom of the box with his head and coins that Mario could collect. There were turtles that would move around and piranha plants that would rise out of the ground. Mario and other entities had animations in that the render would alternate between two pictures to appear that they were walking. Finally, there was the option to create a level by oneself. One could then save the level and proceed to play it. The level would remain saved even as the program ended through the use of files.
